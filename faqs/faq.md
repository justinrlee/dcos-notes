# FAQs

This page is a generic list of how-to's and FAQs for DC/OS.

## How do I find the latest version of the DC/OS CLI?

DC/OS CLI releases do not strictly line up with the DC/OS versions - they're released independently.  Because of this, the DC/OS CLI links found in the DC/OS UI may not always be up to date.  You can find the latest versions here:

https://github.com/dcos/dcos-cli/releases

## How come I can't use the `dcos security` command?

The `dcos security` command comes from the dcos-enterprise-cli Universe package, and can be installed by running `dcos package install dcos-enterprise-cli --cli`.  Note that the features of this CLI add-on will only work with the Enterprise edition of DC/OS.

## How do I configure additional Mesos attributes on my nodes, for use with constraints?

The official documentation for this can be found here: https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/installing/faq/#q.-how-to-add-mesos-attributes-to-nodes-to-use-marathon-constraints

Alternately, you can do this on a per-node basis by:

1) Editing and/or creating /var/lib/dcos/mesos-slave-common

2) Add a line with the MESOS_ATTRIBUTES environment variable (this will be read by the dcos-mesos-slave or dcos-mesos-slave-public systemd unit):

    ```
    MESOS_ATTRIBUTES=location:bare_metal;disk_type:ssd
    ```

    (You can specify additional attributes by separating by semicolons)

3) Remove the old slave metadata and restart the dcos-mesos-slave (or dcos-mesos-slave-public) service:

    ```
    # Replace dcos-mesos-slave with dcos-mesos-slave-public for public agents:
    sudo systemctl stop dcos-mesos-slave
    sudo rm /var/lib/dcos/mesos-resources
    sudo rm /var/lib/mesos/slave/meta/slaves/latest
    # Replace dcos-mesos-slave with dcos-mesos-slave-public for public agents:
    sudo systemctl start dcos-mesos-slave
    ```

4) Most likely required: if the service doesn't come up, remove `/var/lib/mesos/slave/meta/slaves/latest`:

    ```bash
    sudo rm /var/lib/mesos/slave/meta/slaves/latest
    ```

## How do I change the resources for a DC/OS node?

**This will kill all tasks running on the agent**

1) Make your changes to the agent node (change number of CPUs/memory/disk, etc.)

2) Stop the agent service:

    For private agents:
    ```
    sudo sh -c 'systemctl kill -s SIGUSR1 dcos-mesos-slave && systemctl stop dcos-mesos-slave'
    ```

    For public agents:
    ```
    ⁠⁠⁠⁠sudo sh -c 'systemctl kill -s SIGUSR1 dcos-mesos-slave-public && systemctl stop dcos-mesos-slave-public'
    ```

3) Remove the metadata and mesos resources files (these will be re-generated on agent start):

    ```
    sudo rm /var/lib/dcos/mesos-resources
    sudo rm /var/lib/mesos/slave/meta/slaves/latest
    ```

4) Start the agent back up:

    For private agents:
    ```
    systemctl start dcos-mesos-slave
    ```

    For public agents:
    ```
    systemctl start dcos-mesos-slave-public
    ```

## How do I determine what version of DC/OS a specific node is on?

Look at /opt/mesosphere/etc/dcos-version.json

## What is this `jq` command I see throughout the documentation?

'jq' is an open source command-line JSON parser.  It can be found here: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

You can quickly install it with this:

```

curl -LO https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.5/jq-linux64
chmod 755 jq-linux64
sudo cp -p jq-linux64 /usr/bin/jq

```

## My agents are complaining about certificate issues when trying to obtain items from URIs.  How do I fix this?

If you're using self-signed or custom certificates on your artifact repositories, you can configure your agents to trust them (in DC/OS 1.9.x) by completing the following:

1) Copy your custom CA cert or certificate to /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/cert (create this directory if it does not exist already)

2) Hash your certificate, and use the hash output as the filename for a soft link to the actual certificate.

For example:

```bash

mkdir -p /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs
cp test.pem /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs/
cd /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs/
ln -s test.pem "$(openssl x509 -hash -noout -in "test.pem")".0

```

This should result in a directory that looks roughly like this:

```bash
[root@ip-10-10-0-138 certs]# ll
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root    8 Apr 26 00:33 87e86989.0 -> test.pem
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1285 Apr 26 00:31 test.pem
```

## How do I configure the Mesos fetcher to pull data from HDFS?
Each Mesos agent needs a set of hadoop binaries present on it (configured with proper `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`).  Additionally, you must pass in the environment variable `MESOS_HADOOP_HOME` to your mesos agent.

For example, to configure this to work with the DC/OS hdfs package, you can run something similar to the following:

```bash

# Switch to root:
sudo su -

# Download the hadoop binary package
curl -LO http://mirror.reverse.net/pub/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.5/hadoop-2.6.5.tar.gz
# Extract it and put in /opt/hadoop
tar -xzvf hadoop-2.6.5.tar.gz
mv hadoop-2.6.5 /opt/hadoop

# Install java in case it's not already installed
yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk

# Download core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml to /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop (and back up the existing instances)
cd /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop/
mv hdfs-site.xml hdfs-site.xml.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
mv core-site.xml core-site.xml.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
curl -O api.hdfs.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:80/v1/endpoints/core-site.xml
curl -O api.hdfs.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:80/v1/endpoints/hdfs-site.xml

echo "MESOS_HADOOP_HOME=/opt/hadoop/" >> /var/lib/dcos/mesos-slave-common
systemctl restart dcos-mesos-slave

```
